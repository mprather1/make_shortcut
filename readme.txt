Make sure all of the script files are exactly where you want to be in your documents folder or your data drive. Open a terminal in the folder containing this file and run the installation by typing 'bash install.sh' into the terminal. Restart your terminal and you can make shortcuts to commands by typing 'make_shortcut' into the terminal. Enter the shortcut you want and the command and restart the terminal. Now you have a shortcut to that command that you can run in the terminal. Shortcuts cannot have any spaces, if you need to use more than one word use underscores or dashes.
